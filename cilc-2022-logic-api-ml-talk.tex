\section{Context, Motivation, \& Goals}
%===============================================================================

%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\begin{frame}[c]{Context}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prolog is the most prominent LP technology\ccite{prolog50years-tplp}
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item used to implement other logic-based technologies\ccite{lptech4mas-jaamas35}
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item Plenty of libraries supporting ML in mainstream languages
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item main features: training, (de)serialising, or using ML predictors
            %
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[eg] Scikit-Learn or Tensorflow for Python
                \item[eg] Smile or \deeplearningforj{} on the JVM
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item Poor interoperability among LP and ML
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item mostly due to the lack of technologies bridging them
            \item arguably slowing down research about hybrid systems
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\begin{frame}[c]{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Need to fill the (technological) gap among ML and LP
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item especially for what concerns the ``LP calls ML'' case
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item Support the exploitation of ML predictors in LP
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[eg] for training, (de)serialising, or using them
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item Enable the exploitation of trained predictors as logic predicates

        \vfill

        \item Support the implementation of hybrid systems
         %
         \begin{itemize}
            \item[ie] where symbolic AI is used to govern or combine sub-symbolic predictors
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\begin{frame}{Goal of the Paper}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Propose a logic API for ML
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[ie] a set of logic predicates for working ML, in LP
            \item covering all phases of a ML workflow
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item Design a technological architecture for re-using existing ML libraries

        \vfill

        \item Select technologies for prototyping the API

        \vfill

        \item Highlight the (expected) benefits
    \end{enumerate}
